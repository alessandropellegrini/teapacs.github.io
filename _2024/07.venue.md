## FCRC '23

FCRC '23 assembles a spectrum of affiliated research conferences and workshops into a week-long, co-located, meeting. This model retains the advantages of the smaller conferences, while at the same time facilitating communication among researchers in different fields of computer science and engineering. Each morning FCRC features a joint plenary talk on topics of broad appeal to the computing research community.

The technical program for each affiliated conference is independently administered, and each is responsible for its own meeting's structure, content, and proceedings. To the extent facilities allow, attendees are free to attend technical sessions of other affiliated conferences co-located with their "home" conference.
