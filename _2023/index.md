The First International Workshop on Teaching Performance Analysis of Computer Systems (TeaPACS 2021) was in 2021, co-located with the IFIP Performance conference in Milano, Italy.
It was motivated by the observation that, in the 50 years since the formation of ACM SIGMETRICS and IFIP TC 7 (which includes WG 7.3 Computer System Modeling), computing systems have changed drastically, and the growing complexity of systems, services and their relative context makes it more urgent and critical to model and analyse systems performance and behaviour. On the other hand, the teaching of performance modeling has faced cutbacks,
as budgets are squeezed, and student interests shift.

TeaPACS1 aimed to take stock of performance analysis as a discipline and discuss how our community should respond to this challenge. The abstracts for the talks and a recording of the discussions can be found in [Performance Evaluation Review](https://dl.acm.org/toc/sigmetrics/2022/49/4 ) and at the [TeaPACS1 website](https://www.performance2021.deib.polimi.it/www.performance2021.deib.polimi.it/teapacs/).

This Second Workshop (TeaPACS 2023) aims to explore further the issues raised in TeaPACS 2021: the importance of performance analysis, ignorance of related concepts among industry engineers and systems researchers, students' weakness in mathematical preparation, the need to accommodate their current interests and learning habits, etc.

We issue here a call for academics, engineers and students to participate in TeaPACS 2023.  We have invited speakers who will provide keynotes on the above issues. However, the workshop's success depends on a productive dialogue and deliberation among all participants to summarise the state of our discipline and suggest a course of action for growing performance modeling and analysis.
