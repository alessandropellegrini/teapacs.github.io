The workshop on Teaching Performance Analysis of Computer Systems (TeaPACS) was born on the fiftieth anniversary of SIGMETRICS, aiming to take stock of performance modeling analysis as a discipline. It was in 2021, co-located with the IFIP Performance conference in Milano, Italy.
The need to open the discussion on this topic comes, on the one hand, from the obvious consideration that, in the 50 years since the formation of ACM SIGMETRICS and IFIP TC 7 (which includes WG 7.3 Computer System Modeling), computing systems have changed drastically. The growing complexity of systems, services, and their relative context makes it more urgent and critical to model and analyse the performance and behaviour of systems. On the other hand, the teaching of performance modeling has faced cutbacks as budgets are squeezed and student interests shift.
The workshop aims to stimulate discussion on how the community should respond to this challenge. Consequently, the chosen format is to have invited speakers and discussions open to all participants.
