## Giuliano Casale
## Performance evaluation teaching in the age of cloud computing

Cloud computing has been a primary ICT driver during the last 15 years, fostering sharp changes in performance engineering practices across the computing industry and, at the same time, profoundly steering research trends in academia. A distinctive trait of this paradigm is that cloud engineers can programmatically control software and system performance, raising an expectation for computing graduates who find employment in this area to be ready to engage in hands-on performance engineering problems. This, in turn, calls for a broader and more profound education on performance topics as part of the computing curriculum. This talk will present my own experience and views on the intersection between cloud computing and performance evaluation teaching. I will also give practical examples of how we can engage students in the performance evaluation discipline and prepare them to tackle quality-of-service engineering challenges that arise in the cloud domain.

Giuliano Casale joined the Department of Computing at Imperial College London in 2010, where he is currently a Reader. He teaches and does research in performance engineering and cloud computing, topics on which he has published more than 150 refereed papers. He has served on the technical program committee of several conferences in performance and dependability. His research work has received multiple recognitions, including best paper awards at ACM SIGMETRICS, IEEE/IFIP DSN, and IEEE INFOCOM. He serves on the editorial boards of IEEE TNSM and ACM TOMPECS, as editor-in-chief of Elsevier PEVA, and as the current chair of ACM SIGMETRICS.
