The Second International Workshop on Teaching Performance Analysis of Computer Systems (T e a P A C S 2023) wants to continue the discussion that was started during the First Workshop.

T e a P A C S 2021 aimed to assess of performance analysis as a discipline and discuss how our community should respond to this challenge. The abstracts for the talks and a recording of the discussions can be found in [Performance Evaluation Review](https://dl.acm.org/toc/sigmetrics/2022/49/4 ) and on the [T e a P A C S 2021 website](https://www.performance2021.deib.polimi.it/www.performance2021.deib.polimi.it/teapacs/index.html).

This Second Workshop aims to explore further the issues raised in T e a P A C S 2021: the importance of performance analysis, ignorance of related concepts among industry engineers and systems researchers, students' weakness in mathematical preparation, the need to accommodate their current interests and learning habits, etc.

We issue here a call for academics, engineers and students to participate in T e a P A C S 2023.  We have invited speakers who will provide keynotes on the above issues. However, the workshop's success depends on a productive dialogue and deliberation among all participants to review the state of our discipline and suggest a course of action for growing performance modeling and analysis.
